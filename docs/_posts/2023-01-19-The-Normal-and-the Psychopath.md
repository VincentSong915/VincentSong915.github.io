*Frenzy* is a film directed by Alfred Hitchcock released on 1972. It is the second last long film of Hitchcock's. Basically it tells a story about a serial murderer who always first raped the victims then strangled them using a tie.

The first time I saw Mr. Blaney was when he had been preparing for work and taken a glass of wine in the counter. He was fired for this. By then he seemed to be tough, anxious and impulsive. Or in another way you can say he was insistent or principled. He went for his friend, Mr. Rusk, to ask for some help. But he didn't accept it eventually out of face. He only took a box of grapes. It is interesting that Mr. Rusk now shows very kind and generous to Blaney. Maybe he has already planned to make Blaney be the scapegoat back then, for the next victim being his ex-wife, Brenda. Until now we can only tell the Mr. Rusk is a good fellow. He even introduced his *mom* to Blaney, who probably was also a victim of Rusk's.

Things changed after Rusk met Brenda at her agency. He claimed his ridiculous requirements of a loving relationship. And Brenda kept refusing him. Then Rusk exposed his real purpose, raping her and killing her. Brenda had nowhere to escape. She tried to negotiate with him in able to earn some time, but unfortunately she didn't make it. Coincidently Blanday came there after she died and was seen by her secretary. And more and more evidences showed up against him. He could hardly make it through. So he chose to hide.

Hitchcock excelled in depicting psychopath. And also in this film he added many analysis about how a sexual psychopath killer would act. *They can be triggered off at any time*. All these characteristics could be found in Blaney, who was irritable, arrogant and violent. But what about Rusk? He is actually pretty nice. Everything seemed to be just normal about him. The directer here projected the psychological activities of the criminal onto the scapegoat, which pushed him to a desperate depth that he could never get rid of. And this made the scapegoat more like the real criminal.

The chief realized that something went wrong finally thanks to the help from his wife. *Women's intuition*, that is what it was called. It is actually kind of patriarchy. Males never understand what women's feeling is and what they want. Neither would they hear from the suspects.
