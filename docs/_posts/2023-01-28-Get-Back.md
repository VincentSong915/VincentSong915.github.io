Every time I go back home and come back school from home, it's like switching from one world to another, distinctive from each other.

## Home

My journey home was on 14th, January. It was a rainy day. I woke up at 6:30 to catch up the flight, which was delay by half an hour after I had arrived the airport. The flight wasn't quit smooth. Clouds filled the sky all along the track. It was nearly 2:00 p.m. when I arrived home. I quickly finished lunch and slept until about 5:00 p.m.. Then I went to my grandparents', whom I hadn't visited for the whole six months.

At home, I was like doing nothing, wasting time on cell phone, watching plenty of movies, sleeping for however long I wanted. And also I spent time with my family, having lunch and supper (cause I usually got up late and thus skipped the breakfast). It was kind of fun to listen to them talking about things that I didn't know, the distant relatives, people living back in the village where I grew up, elderlies died and babies born. Though I was not really interested in these things and could hardly interrupt, I really felt that I was in a family, where people cared about each other and got acquainted from time to time.

And my friends, we hadn't got together for a long time, either. And it would be harder and harder to gather all of the group, since we all have our own things to do. Due to the family planning, most of us don't have any siblings. So we stayed together like brothers.

The day before I left, I had lunch at my grandma's, who cooked jiaozi for me. My aunt and her husband and my cousin also showed up, to have a farewell with me. When I was to leave, my grandfather said, remember to call when you arrived. At the very moment, I felt rather sorrow, not for me not seeing him for another half a year, but for him. He at his seventies must miss us a lot, me and my cousin, even my father and my aunt, though they come to visit him frequently. For years, I have become more and more empathetic, trying to understand my family, take easy with others, trying to be soft. I realized that family really means a lot.

At home I lived as a sum of relationships.

## Back here

As I grow up, I spend less and less time at home. So I use the term 'back' to name where I spend most of the time.

I came back on 28th, January, after 2 weeks at home. It was so cold at the platform that my hands were about to flee. The train was crowded since it's the first working day after the Chinese New Year. On the train I read two chapters of *Crime and Punishment*, watched *Eastern Promises*, slept for a while and read several pages of *The Waves*. It took me 6 hours before arriving in Shanghai, and one more hour to reach my place. I met a cute girl on the subway, with big eyes, wearing a pair of read boots with tiny heels, carrying a small suitcase. She wears a mask so I can't see her entire face. People still must wear masks to take the subway. She got off three stops before me, so I didn't have a chance to say hi. I thought it just impolite to talk with some strangers outside, especially of the opposite gender.

On my way, I had a feeling of freedom. I can do what I want to do, ear what I want to eat, say what I want to say, no need to tell someone in advance. On the other hand, I have burden. I have to do my work.

Here I live as me myself.

## At the end

Another year ended, another year begins. Like it or not, I am leaving your family, without their protection and limitation. I take responsibility for myself. I am looking for what makes me me.
