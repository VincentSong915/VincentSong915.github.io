This is a decision I have made for so long and until now it gets realized.

I always want a tattoo. I can't even remember when this wish started. In other eyes, a tattoo may be correspondent to something negative, for it was at the very beginning branded on those prisoners. And it may be related to gangsters. All in all, it reminds people nothing positive, in our society. But I really don't think that way. I think tattoo can be anything, anything you want it to be. It can be a demonstration, a decoration, or even a hobby. It might be connect with something. But it does not have to be. To me, tattoo is a demonstration. It's a presentation of rebelling, against those stereotype, the rules, the common sense.

I was always wanting a tattoo, but haven't been able to get one. I found myself excuses, basically finance related. And I don't know what to be tattooed. The styles I'm interested in are dark, bloody, and usually enormous-area-occupied. It's actually not easy to begin with such a tattoo. One day, one of my friends told me that she got her first tattoo on travel. She just picked the locally best-scored tattooist and rushed there at night with a random co-traveller. And there she is. She got a simple-line-styled one. That reminds me that I can just take it easy first. Get something simple at first. As the saying goes,'You cannot become a fat ass with one bite.'

I browsed on the Red Book to look for some good tattooists. I found a Danish girl whose style was exactly what I want. I messaged her on Instagram but she was then on vacation and didn't reply me. When she came back in Shanghai finishing her vacation, I had went home for Chinese New Year. So it's interesting. 

When we're both finally in Shanghai, I tried to contact her and figure out what we can doing with. I skimmed her flashed. I first noticed this fish, it said, 'A sad fish in a sad tank waiting for the end of its sad life.' It comes from a real fish lying in a real tank in a real supermarket. Unfortunately it was token.

And finally we decided to work on this, 'Death is a forever dream', with an interesting drawing. It's not a tendency of suicide, but a positive attitude toward death. Like, death is nothing to fear about, definitely not. Everyone dies. When one dies, she goes to another world, she extinguishes, she dreams forever. Whatever. It's a normal thing. It happens everyday. No need to fear.

I asked the story behind the flash. She said one day she was thinking what was death like. She thought it might be like a dream. So she closed her eyes and drew on the paper like in a dream, to see what she could get. And there it is. It attracts me because its ambiguity and infinite possibility. I thought I looks like a man wearing a pair of glasses and siting in a sofa. To me it seems like cubism. But she hasn't really thought like that. As the tattooing proceeding, she suddenly come up that it also looks like a dinosaur twisting his neck. Very amazing right. After the tattoo was finished, she took me a photo, and it was really really amazing. We both love it.

Another thing finished in my wish list!
